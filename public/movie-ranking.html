<h1>The Best Movies According to Divya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2> <hr />

<h3>The Shashank Redemption</h3>
<p>I love the movie. It is a thriller movie and will keep you on your toes throughout the whole movie.</p>

<h3>Catch me if you can</h3>
<p>This movie is based on real life and though all of it is a crime it does make you wonder how a human brain can be so intelligent.</p>

<h3>The Intern</h3>
<p>This is one of my personal favourites. This movie is always an inspiration for me.</p>
